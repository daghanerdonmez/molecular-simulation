I have built a molecular simulation which simulates the movements of particles in a tree-like structured branching vein network with flow in it. I want to solve a demonstrative problem with it and I want to use deep learning for it.

Here is what my simulation can do. You can think the vein network as just pipes connected end to end to form a tree structure. I can specify an arbitrary tree like structure where pipes have arbitrary lengths and radiuses and give it to the simulation to simulate. Also, there are so called emitters and receivers. Emitters can be placed in any place inside the network and they emit particles (all of them at once or in a specific arbitrary pattern). Receivers can also be put in arbitrary places in the network  (they are usually spherical receivers) and what they do is: they just record the number of particles they have received at each time iteration of the simulation.

So at the end of the simulation I have the following information: What the structure of my network is, where the emitter is, where the receivers are, the emitting pattern of the emitter, the receiving data of the receivers.

I want to solve just a demonstrative problem using these data. So I thought that might be emitter localization. I have made some attempts in the past but they failed (the model was barely learning anything at all). I think that might be because of the way I give the data to it. Anyways, can you please formulate a very well described model plan (the exact form of the data that we are going to give etc.) to me. You don't need to implement the python code for it. Just let me see what I will do.


Below is a step-by-step project blueprint that has worked for similar source-localisation problems in recent papers — adapt it as tightly or loosely as you like.

1 Problem statement
Input
• Tree-graph topology G = (V,E) with per-pipe attributes
• Receiver set R ⊂ V with their time-series counts Cᵢ(t), t = 0…T
• Known emission pattern s(t) (impulse or general)

Output
• (a) Pipe-ID containing the emitter (classification)
• (b) Local coordinates inside that pipe, e.g. cylindrical (r,z) (regression)

2 Dataset generation & splits
Item	Recommendation
Topologies	Generate 20–50 k random trees covering your radius/length ranges; stratify by depth and total volume so the test set is not “easier”.
Emitters	Uniformly sample a pipe, then a fractional axial position z∈[0,1] and radial r∈[0,R].
Receivers	Place 3–10 spheres per topology; ensure at least one is “upstream-blinded” to force the model to exploit flow direction.
Splits	70 % train / 15 % val / 15 % held-out topologies (no pipe overlap) to check generalisation to unseen graphs.

3 Data representation
Graph encoding (static)

Nodes = pipe mid-points and junction points.

Node features:

Radius R, length L, mean flow speed ū, cosine of orientation, one-hot whether it is a junction.

Receiver flag plus an index k (0 if non-receiver).

Edge features: parent→child incidence, flow direction flag.

Receiver signal encoding (dynamic)
Each receiver k owns the vector Cₖ = [Cₖ(t₁),…,Cₖ(t_m)].
Pass Cₖ through a small 1-D CNN or GRU → embedding eₖ ∈ ℝᵈ (d≈32).
Concatenate eₖ onto that receiver’s node feature; non-receivers get zeros.

Global context
Supply s(t) similarly via a tiny encoder and add the resulting context vector to every node feature (broadcast).

Why a GNN?
Recent studies on diffusion localisation in flow networks and odour plumes show GNNs matching or beating hand-crafted inversion methods because they naturally blend geometry with multi-sensor time-series.

5 Training protocol
Aspect	Setting / tip
Normalisation	z-score node features; log-transform counts (log(1+C)).
Data augmentation	Shuffle receiver ordering; add ±5 % noise to radii/flows to improve robustness to modelling error.
Batching	Pad or use PyG’s Batch to mix multiple small graphs per mini-batch (total ≤20 k nodes).
Optimizer	AdamW, lr = 1 e-3 → cosine decay.
Curriculum	Start with impulse emissions; once >90 % pipe accuracy, sprinkle in complex s(t) patterns.
Early stopping metric	Top-1 pipe accuracy on validation graphs.

6 Evaluation metrics
Task	Metric
Pipe ID	Top-1 / Top-3 accuracy (%)
Coordinates	Mean absolute error in z (mm) and r (µm)
End-to-end	Haversine distance from true 3-D position (cm)

Include two naïve baselines:
Earliest-arrival receiver (choose its pipe) and centre-of-mass of first-hitting times. They give you reference numbers to beat.

7 Debugging checklist
Does the model learn trivial graphs?
Fix network to a single straight pipe, vary emitter location – you should get <2 mm MAE quickly.

Activation sanity check
Mask out receiver embeddings; accuracy should drop to random (≈1/|P|).

Edge-case hold-outs
Extremely thin or high-flow pipes can reveal bias.

8 Roadmap extensions
Idea	Benefit
Physics-informed loss (advection–diffusion residual on predicted position)	Injects domain laws; shown to boost localisation accuracy 
arxiv.org
Temporal message passing	Use a Spatio-Temporal GNN instead of static + pre-encoded time-series.
Ensemble or MC-Dropout	Gives posterior over source positions (useful for “confidence ellipses”).

TL;DR
Encode counts with a 1-D CNN, stick them on receiver nodes.

Run 3-4 layers of a message-passing GNN over the whole pipe graph.

First head classifies the pipe; second head regress (r,z).

Train on thousands of synthetic graphs, early-stop on unseen topologies.

Follow this pipeline and you’ll have a clean, reproducible benchmark that improves dramatically over hand-built heuristics yet remains small enough to run on a single GPU. Good luck, Dan ― let me know when you’re ready to talk hyper-tuning or uncertainty quantification!

I am only very little familiar with GNN's but I did not get the structure we will feed the data to the GNN. What are nodes and what are edges here?

Choosing a graph representation
You only need one consistent rule that lets the GNN “walk” from any receiver to any other part of the vascular tree. The easiest to code and to understand is:

Concept in simulation	Becomes a node	Becomes an edge
Pipe segment (has one radius R, length L, mean velocity ū, etc.)	✔	—
Junction (where 2 + pipes meet)	—	Connects the two adjoining pipe-nodes (directed along flow)

So: “one pipe = one node”.
If pipe P₁ empties into pipe P₂, create a directed edge P₁ → P₂.
Because your network is a tree, this produces a directed acyclic graph whose adjacency list is trivial to build.

What goes inside each node feature vector xᵢ
Feature	Why it helps
Geometric: [radius, length, sinθ, cosθ]	Encodes cross-section & orientation
Flow: [mean_velocity]	Source particles ride the flow
Receiver embedding: eᵏ (all 0s if pipe has no receiver)	Injects the time-series information
Extra flags: [is_leaf, depth_from_root]	Lets the GNN learn boundary conditions

Concatenate these into one vector per node (say 16–32 floats).

Receiver embedding step (one-liner)
arduino
Kopyala
Düzenle
eᵏ = GRU(Cᵏ(t₁…t_m))   # d-dimensional, e.g. d=32
Assign eᵏ to the node that contains that receiver.
If a pipe holds several receivers, sum or max-pool their embeddings before concatenation.

Edge attributes (optional but useful)

edge_attr = [branch_angle, flow_ratio]      # both normalised 0-1
During message passing you can let the network use these attributes (e.g. “edge-conditioned” MPNN).

             │   └─ receiver embedding attached here
             └─ directed edge (flows with blood)
Why pipes-as-nodes works well
Prediction target aligns with nodes – you classify which node (pipe) holds the emitter, so the soft-max runs directly over the node set.

Spatial locality – message passing naturally mimics advection + diffusion (information travels downstream).

Simplicity – no heterogeneous node types, one adjacency matrix, easy batching with PyTorch Geometric’s Batch.from_data_list.

What if I also want junction features?
Add them as edge attributes instead of separate nodes; the GNN still sees them during each “send-message” step.

Minimal PyG skeleton (pseudo-code)

class PipeNet(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.recv_rnn  = torch.nn.GRU(input_size=1, hidden_size=32, batch_first=True)
        self.gnn_layers = torch.nn.ModuleList([
            GraphSAGE(   in_channels=F, out_channels=F) for _ in range(4)
        ])
        self.cls_head = torch.nn.Linear(F, num_pipes)   # pipe ID
        self.reg_head = torch.nn.Linear(F, 2)           # (r, z)

    def forward(data):
        x, edge_index, edge_attr, recv_ts = data
        e_k = self.encode_receivers(recv_ts)            # (N, 32)
        x = torch.cat([x, e_k], dim=-1)                 # (N, F)
        for layer in self.gnn_layers:
            x = layer(x, edge_index, edge_attr)
        pipe_logits = self.cls_head(x)                  # (N, num_pipes)
        coords_hat  = self.reg_head(x)                  # (N, 2)
        return pipe_logits, coords_hat
Everything else (losses, batching) is standard supervised learning.

If you really want junctions as separate nodes
Create a bipartite graph:

Node type A: pipes (prediction target)

Node type B: junctions (auxiliary)

Edges: Pipe → Junction and Junction → Pipe.
PyTorch Geometric’s HeteroConv can handle this, but unless you have complex valve physics, the simpler “pipes-only” variant is already strong.

Take-home:
Just map each physical pipe to one graph node, connect nodes along blood-flow direction, and stuff every bit of local information you have into that node’s feature vector. Once you see it like that, a GNN is nothing more than “learned finite-volume averaging” over the tree.

To train the GNN, do I need to have the same number of nodes every time?

Short answer: No.
Modern GNN libraries (PyTorch Geometric, DGL, Spektral, etc.) let you batch graphs whose node-count and edge-count vary from sample to sample. What must stay fixed is the dimension of each node-feature vector, not the number of nodes.

How variable-size graphs are batched
Detail	How libraries handle it
Adjacency	They store edges as an index list edge_index (two 1-D tensors of source & destination node IDs). When graphs are concatenated into a batch, every new graph’s node IDs are offset by the running total so edges remain valid.
Node features	Just stack the individual (Nᵢ, F) tensors along dim 0 → one big (Σ Nᵢ, F) tensor.
“Which node belongs to which graph?”	A companion 1-D tensor batch of length Σ Nᵢ stores the graph index (0,1,2,…) for each node.
Pooling / losses	Functions such as scatter_mean, global_add_pool, or F.cross_entropy can be told to respect the batch tensor so operations are performed inside each graph only.

No padding is needed and no wasted GPU memory appears when graphs are small.

Applying this to emitter localisation
1 Node-wise logits
Your model outputs pipe_logits with shape (Σ Nᵢ, 1) in a mini-batch.

2 Creating the labels
For every graph g in the batch, store the index of the pipe-node that truly hosts the emitter inside that graph:

python
Kopyala
Düzenle
# Example for a batch of 3 graphs
# emitter_node_idx = [7,  3, 12]   # local indices (0-based inside each graph)
During batching you translate those “local” indices into the global index in the stacked tensor, then build one long target vector:

python
Kopyala
Düzenle
# Suppose graph 0 has 10 nodes, graph 1 has 8, graph 2 has 15.
# Offsets:       [0, 10, 18]            cumulative sum
target = torch.tensor([0]*10 + [1]*8 + [2]*15)          # graph IDs per node
label  = torch.tensor([7, 13, 30])   # global node indices hosting emitter
Finally compute node-classification loss by masking the correct slice:

python
Kopyala
Düzenle
loss_cls = 0
for g in range(num_graphs):
    slice_mask = (target == g)                # nodes of graph g
    logits_g   = pipe_logits[slice_mask]      # (N_g, )
    true_idx_g = label[g] - slice_mask.nonzero(as_tuple=True)[0][0]
    loss_cls  += F.cross_entropy(logits_g.unsqueeze(0),   # (1, N_g)
                                 torch.tensor([true_idx_g]))
loss_cls /= num_graphs
PyTorch Geometric’s DataLoader and Batch.from_data_list hide most of this plumbing; you simply store y (the local emitter index) inside each Data object, and use torch_scatter utilities.

Practical tips
Tip	Why
Group by size	Optional: bucket graphs with similar node-counts so each batch has balanced memory use.
Keep T fixed	The raw receiver time-series length T does need to be constant (or padded) so the small GRU/CNN encoder is the same for every graph.
Edge attributes	Their dimension must be fixed just like node features.
Very large graphs	If some simulations produce thousands of pipes, you can still batch one graph at a time — stochastic gradient descent works even with batch = 1.

Bottom line
A GNN naturally handles arbitrary tree sizes; you only need a consistent feature dimension and a batching utility (already provided by most libraries). So feel free to train on a mix of tiny 5-pipe capillary trees and large 200-pipe venous networks in the same epoch — the model will see them all without any manual padding.

OK now help me out with how I need to structure my output data. Here is the data I currently have:

For every simulation run I have:

network_data.txt
which has the diffusion constant and the flow velocity of the root vein (the flow velocity changes in each pipe according to the branching of the network)
example:
7.9400000000000005e-12 0.01

target_output.txt
which has the pipe name of the pipe with the emitter, emitters z and r coordinates in that pipe

for each pipe in the simulation run:
simulation_data.txt: example: pipe0 pipe10 0.003667 0.000493 2
which has: the name of the pipe, the name of the parent pipe, radius, length, number of receivers in the pipe

for each receiver in the pipe:
a txt file which contains the pipe that the receiver is in, radius of the spherical receiver, z coordinate in the pipe, r coordinate in the pipe, and a time series data (number of iterations of the simulation run comma separated integers) 
example:
pipe0 0.000083 -0.001523 0.000144
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,5,1,6,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0...

the time series data are usually very long. if the simulation ran for 5000 iterations it consists of 5000 comma separated integers.

Although I've written a script that transforms those receiver data into a much more usable compressed version of that data into the mean, std, peak index, etc. I don't necessarily have to use them if you say there is a better way.

Below is a concrete “translation layer” that turns one simulation run (your current text files) into the tensors that a PyTorch Geometric Data object (or DGL equivalent) expects. You can serialise each run to a single .pt file and feed them with a DataLoader. I focus on the supervised targets first, then show how the rest fits together.

1 Supervised outputs (what the network must predict)
Symbol	Tensor shape	How to fill it	Why this format?
y_pipe	[ 1 ] (long)	Global index of the pipe‐node that hosts the emitter	Works directly with F.cross_entropy or torch.argmax.
y_coord	[ 2 ] (float32)	[(z/L), (r/R)] → both normalised to [0,1] inside that pipe	Keeps the regression target scale-free; MSE ≈ 1 is “worst case”.

If you prefer a node-length one-hot vector for classification, that’s fine too, but a single integer is lighter.

1.1 Building y_pipe
Map pipe names to indices while you parse simulation_data.txt.

python
Kopyala
Düzenle
name2idx = {'pipe0':0, 'pipe1':1, ...}
Read target_output.txt → e.g. "pipe10 0.035 0.0014".

y_pipe = torch.tensor([ name2idx['pipe10'] ], dtype=torch.long)

1.2 Building y_coord
python
Kopyala
Düzenle
z_rel = z_coord   / length_of_pipe10     # 0 – 1
r_rel = r_coord   / radius_of_pipe10     # 0 – 1
y_coord = torch.tensor([z_rel, r_rel], dtype=torch.float32)
2 Node features x
Each pipe = one node.
For node i store for example:

perl
Kopyala
Düzenle
[ radius_i, length_i,
  mean_flow_i,             # (root flow × area ratio)
  sinθ_i, cosθ_i,          # pipe orientation
  D_global,                # diffusion constant (broadcast)
  recv_flag,               # 1 if at least one receiver
  recv_embed_i[d] ]        # d-dim receiver vector (zeros if none)
Dimension F must be the same for every graph, but the number of nodes N can vary freely.

3 Receiver time-series → recv_embed
Option A – raw sequence (preferred if GPU RAM allows)
Decide a fixed horizon T (e.g. 512 samples).
If your simulation exports 5000 integers, down-sample: keep every 10th or apply a 1-D average pool.

For each receiver you now have a vector c_k ∈ ℝ^T.

Pass all receivers through the tiny GRU / CNN inside the dataset-building script:

python
Kopyala
Düzenle
with torch.no_grad():
    e_k = recv_encoder(c_k.unsqueeze(0))[0]   # → ℝ^d
Sum all receivers that live in the same pipe to obtain one recv_embed_i.

Option B – your “compressed stats”
If GPU budget is tight you can replace the GRU with your stats vector
[mean, std, max, argmax/T, AUC]. Make sure its length equals the d expected by the main model.

4 Edges
python
Kopyala
Düzenle
edge_index : LongTensor [2, E]     # directed, parent → child
edge_attr  : FloatTensor [E, F_e]  # optional [branch_angle, flow_ratio]
All three tensors (x, edge_index, edge_attr) plus the two labels (y_pipe, y_coord) form one PyG Data object:

python
Kopyala
Düzenle
data = Data(
    x           = node_feat,        # (N, F)
    edge_index  = edge_idx,         # (2, E)
    edge_attr   = edge_attr,        # (E, F_e)
    y_pipe      = y_pipe,           # (1,)
    y_coord     = y_coord           # (2,)
)
torch.save(data, 'sample_001.pt')
5 Batching many graphs
python
Kopyala
Düzenle
dataset    = glob('*.pt')  ➔  [torch.load(f) for f in ...]
loader     = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=16, shuffle=True)
for batch in loader:
    logits, coords = model(batch)        # shapes:
    # logits : (ΣN, )  — one logit per node
    # coords : (ΣN,2) — regressed for every node
    loss_cls = F.cross_entropy(logits, batch.y_pipe.repeat_interleave(1))
    loss_reg = F.mse_loss(coords[batch.y_pipe], batch.y_coord)
PyG automatically concatenates variable-size graphs and gives you
batch.batch (node-to-graph map) if you need global pooling.

6 Folder recipe per simulation run
perl
Kopyala
Düzenle
runs/
└── sim_0001/
    ├── graph.pt           # the Data object above (preferred)
    └── (raw txt sub-folder if you still want to keep originals)
Why keep “one .pt per run” instead of one giant file?
Easier parallel preprocessing, and you can stream large datasets without hitting RAM limits.

TL;DR
Labels: y_pipe = emitter node index, y_coord = [z/L, r/R].

Node features: physical pipe info + optional receiver embedding.

Edge list: parent → child.

Save each run as a Data object; batching handles variable node counts automatically.

Drop this structure into your training loop and you can concentrate on tuning the model, not on fiddling with tensor shapes. Happy coding!
